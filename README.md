# Dining Philosophers Problem
I‚Äôve implemented a simulation of the Dining Philosophers Problem in C using threads and mutexes. In this problem, philosophers sit around a table with a bowl of spaghetti and alternate between eating, thinking, and sleeping. To eat, a philosopher needs two forks‚Äîone from their left and one from their right. After eating, they return the forks and start sleeping, then resume thinking. The simulation ends if a philosopher starves. The goal is to ensure no philosopher starves, as they don't communicate or know if another is starving.

## Input arguments
My program accepts following inputs arguments:
| Argument                                | Description                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **number_of_philosophers**              | The number of philosophers and forks.                                                               |
| **time_to_die**                         | A philosopher dies if they don't start eating within this time since their last meal or the simulation start. |
| **time_to_eat**                         | The time required for a philosopher to eat, during which they need two forks.                        |
| **time_to_sleep**                       | The time a philosopher spends sleeping.                                                             |
| **number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat** (optional) | The simulation stops if all philosophers have eaten this many times. If not provided, it stops when a philosopher dies. |
